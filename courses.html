                          <p>You will learn how to think in  algorithmic way , to construct a step-by-step process for solving a problem. Algorithmic thinking is not solving for a specific answer; instead, it solves how to build a sequential, complete, and replicable process that has an end point – an algorithm. Designing an algorithm helps users to both communicate and interpret clear instructions for a predictable, reliable output. This course is recommended for students and their teachers to start programming in Scratch Visual Programming Language.</p>

                          <p>Climate change is arguably one of the biggest issues hanging around the planet earth for
                            more than a decade. Trying to understand and predict how climate change will affect
                            the world is a tough problem. This course describes what is climate change?, how it is
                            caused, why it is dangerous?, how to change climate change and how computer science can be
                            used to tackle climate change Issues. Scientists rely on computer models to better
                            understand the earth’s climate system because they cannot conduct large-scale experiments on
                            the atmosphere itself.</p>
